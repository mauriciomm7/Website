This technique is also referred to as matrix decomposition method. Matrix factorization allows a matrix A of [m×n] order to be decomposed into factor matrices X and Y such that on multiplying these factors will produce the original matrix. Such that A=XY, where X is a [m×r] matrix and Y is a [r×n] matrix [66].
