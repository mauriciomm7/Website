I am soon to gradute from a Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters in *European Politics and Society* at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/humanities/graduate-school). I’m also a contributing author and founding member of the [*European Waves*](https://www.europeanwaves.com/eps-spotlight/) blog. My research interests comprise the evolutionary trajectories of political systems, democratic performance, and data science.

Within Comparative Politics, I investigate the evolutionary trajectories of political systems and their specific institutions. By leveraging insights from political theory, I develop empirically testable research designs that allow for more scientific comparisons across time and space. One fundamental question that animates my research relates to the patterns that foster and foreclose the pathways of institutional change. That is, how do sets of institutional arrangements vary in their performance across democratic polities?

As for data science, I aim to build breaches between empirical research on democracy and novel data collection and processing techniques. Particularly, I explore the variation in the performance of democratic institutions derived from variables such as kinship, impersonal trust, or degree of market integration.

Lastly, I am a regular commentator on European and International Affairs for venues including European Waves, and [the Loop: ECPR](https://theloop.ecpr.eu/) and a recurring guest lecturer at [*the Tecnológico de Monterrey*](https://tec.mx/en/about-us) in Mexico.
