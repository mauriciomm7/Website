<!-- I am soon to gradute from a Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters in *European Politics and Society* at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/humanities/graduate-school). I’m also a contributing author and founding member of the [*European Waves*](https://www.europeanwaves.com/eps-spotlight/) blog. My research interests comprise the evolutionary trajectories of political systems, democratic performance, and data science.

Within Comparative Politics, I investigate the evolutionary trajectories of political systems and their specific institutions. By leveraging insights from political theory, I develop empirically testable research designs that allow for more scientific comparisons across time and space. One fundamental question that animates my research relates to the patterns that foster and foreclose the pathways of institutional change. That is, how do sets of institutional arrangements vary in their performance across democratic polities?

As for data science, I aim to build breaches between empirical research on democracy and novel data collection and processing techniques. Particularly, I explore the variation in the performance of democratic institutions derived from variables such as kinship, impersonal trust, or degree of market integration.

Lastly, I am a regular commentator on European and International Affairs for venues including European Waves, and [the Loop: ECPR](https://theloop.ecpr.eu/) and a recurring guest lecturer at [*the Tecnológico de Monterrey*](https://tec.mx/en/about-us) in Mexico.

I am a Doctoral Research Fellow at [ARENA Centre for European Studies](https://www.sv.uio.no/arena/english/) of the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/). My research focuses on the interaction between the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and the European Commission in relation to the violations of the rule of law and the core principles of EU membership. Specifically, it investigates the rationale behind the mercurial deployment of tools by the EU in response to rule of law breaches in Hungary and Poland after 2010. This research is situated within the purview of WP2 of the ENROL project. 

I graduated from [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en), the Netherlands, with an Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters in *European Politics and Society* and from the *[Tecnológico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/en/about-us)*, Mexico, with a BA in International Relations. Also, I am regular commentator on European and International Affairs for venues including  *[European Waves](https://www.europeanwaves.com/eps-spotlight/)* and [the Loop: ECPR](https://theloop.ecpr.eu/) and a recurring guest lecturer at the Tecnológico de Monterrey in Mexico. 

Additionally, my broader research interests comprise the evolutionary trajectories of political systems, democratic institutions, and data science. Through comparative politics, I investigate the evolutionary trajectories of political systems and their specific institutions. Particularly institutions such as courts, electoral systems, and legislatures. By leveraging insights from political theory, I develop empirically testable research designs that allow for more scientific comparisons across time and space. One fundamental question that animates my research relates to the patterns that foster and foreclose the pathways of institutional change. That is: *how do sets of institutional arrangements vary in their performance across democratic polities?*

As for data science, I aim to build breaches between empirical research on democracy and novel data collection and processing techniques. Particularly, I explore the variation in the performance of democratic institutions derived from variables such as kinship, impersonal trust, or degree of market integration.
